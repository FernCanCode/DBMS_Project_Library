- **Created `schema.sql`**: Implemented the initial database schema provided by the user. This includes tables for `Library_Card`, `Identification`, `Computers_Session`, `Book`, `Items`, and `Fine`.

- **Fixed `seed_data.py`**: Resolved a syntax error in the password string and updated `DB_USER`/`DB_PASS` with correct credentials.
- **Database Setup**: Created the `library` database, applied `schema.sql`, and successfully seeded it with data.
- **Created `.streamlit/secrets.toml`**: Configured database connection secrets for the Streamlit app.
- **Created `app.py`**: Built the core Streamlit application with:
    - **Dashboard**: Key metrics and recent activity.
    - **Book Search**: Functionality to search books by title, author, or ISBN.
    - **Member Lookup**: View member details, checkouts, and fines.
- **Added Checkout/Return**: Implemented separate pages for checking out and returning books, with database updates.
- **Added Admin Features**: Implemented an Admin Login (`admin`/`password`) in the sidebar that unlocks "All Members" and "All Books" pages.
